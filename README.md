# 🏛️ Architectural Style Classification

## 📄 Abstract

This research explores architectural styles from the late Ottoman and early Republican periods using advanced neural network architectures. The study aims to classify architects and visualize their relationships, introducing a curated dataset customized for architectural intricacies. Rigorous analysis of four key convolutional neural network (CNN) models—baseline, VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet—reveals EfficientNet as the most effective model. EfficientNet achieves high accuracy on both Architects-Top and Architects-All datasets. Beyond classification, the research employs t-SNE dimension reduction to unveil hidden connections between architects, providing a deeper understanding of their distinctive styles.

## 🌐 Research Objectives
The primary goal is to understand the evolution of architectural styles during the specified historical periods. The study delves into the distinctive styles of architects who played key roles in shaping the First and Second National Architectural Movements.
